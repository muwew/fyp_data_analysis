3/18/2025 22:03,Avelin Thalia Onggo,Mode 1,0-1,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,"memory, usually i remember well",reading. i easily feel sleepy when i read
3/18/2025 13:50,Brynner Soh Yang Jun,Mode 1,4-Feb,3,5,3,4,2,4,4,"probably problem solving, i like solving shiet",MY ATTENTION SPAN IS SHORT AF IDKY I JST CANT PAY ATTENTION WELL
3/18/2025 10:08,Koh Elin,Mode 1,0-1,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,spatial reasoning?? I'm not sure. I can probably visualise things better in my brain.,short-term memory.. I think I tend to forget things..
3/18/2025 22:02,Le Ngoc Mai,Mode 1,0-1,1,1,3,4,3,4,2,"Pattern recognition i guess? why ah, maybe got adhd idk. quite intuitive for me",spatial reasoning is quite bad. i suck at scaling. i thought taipei 101 is not that tall and mistook a random neighborhood building for taipei 101
3/19/2025 0:38,Melody Tham,Mode 1,4-Feb,2,3,3,2,3,2,3,"I am not very sure how to know the strength of my cognitive skills, but I wpuld say memory (based on remembering passcodes, peoples names, general info etc.). I think it is likely because I played and still do enjoy memory-testing games? Also memory is a big part of life in general. Hence it would be the cognitive skill I get to exercise most.",Pattern recognition (based on idk online tests i guess) I am honestly also not sure why.
3/18/2025 22:01,Tan Zhi Yi Stefan,Mode 1,0-1,1,3,3,3,4,3,2,"Attention span, i am determined to solve problems","spatial reasoning, i find it hard to visualise 3D things"
3/18/2025 10:06,Teh Xue Yi,Mode 1,0-1,1,1,2,3,3,3,3,Pattern recognition? I find that I am generally better at picking out details and make connections ,"My memory is quite poor, I often struggle to recall details"
3/19/2025 0:05,Victoria Wong Xuan Ting,Mode 1,4-Feb,1,5,3,3,2,2,3,"Memory, I can remember visual details easily (I think)","Problem solving, because I'm not the most analytical"
3/18/2025 10:06,Gue Tong En Ashley,Mode 2,0-1,3,1,3,4,5,4,5,"Attention span, I think because I used to read alot as a kid","Probably short-term memory... I dont know why maybe because my brain is saturated, but also because I think I will remember things that are important to me or thing I find worth remembering"
3/18/2025 22:07,Janelle Low Chia Yee,Mode 2,4-Feb,4,3,3,5,4,5,4,"Probably pattern recognition and problem solving, as I like to learn languages and I see similarities in languages.","My weakest is probably short-term memory as I have many thoughts at one moment haha, i have a few commitments."
3/18/2025 22:02,Koh Jia Wei,Mode 2,4-Feb,4,4,3,4,2,3,3,Pattern recognition because i practiced more on that,attention span cos of tiktok
3/18/2025 10:07,Lee Xiang Lin Darren,Mode 2,4-Feb,3,5,5,5,3,4,5,Processive skill because i process information quickly and understand quickly,Attention span. I get distracted easily haha
3/18/2025 11:48,Loh Jie Shuen Jeremy,Mode 2,7-May,4,3,3,4,3,4,3,Problem Solving. I like to consider different perspectives and methods when solving issues. ,Attention span. I have short attention spanâ€¦ I work more efficiently in short bursts of time 
3/18/2025 10:03,Nayoyos Kenneth Moli Akiapas,Mode 2,0-1,2,4,3,4,4,3,3,I would say pattern recognition because I think I am able to quickly pick up and learn new skills using this. When learning programming languages for example,"Short term memory, just because I tend to very quickly forget things when I need to remember them later on"
3/18/2025 10:04,Sih Chee Seng,Mode 2,4-Feb,4,2,4,5,2,5,4,Pattern Recognition. Always enjoyed since young.,Attention span. I'm a kinesthetic learner and prefer hands on engagement.
