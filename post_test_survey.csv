3/20/2025 22:55,Avelin Thalia Onggo,Mode 1,4,4,3,3,3,yes. i figured out some pattern on puzzle and i also figured out a way for me to remember better,4,5,4,4,4,3,4,2,3,"the matching game, cause the duration to remember so short. ","the sequence memorization, cause i remember based on the colour",yes. more used to the style of the game and the rules,4,the different categories of images,nothing hahaha i had so much fun,maybe the first game can give longer time to remember hehe,it was fun and very interesting. never really played a game like this before. jiayou marvell and hoping for the best for you!!!! i'm rooting for you
3/20/2025 10:51,Brynner Soh Yang Jun,Mode 1,2,5,3,4,4,"Yes, especially for my spatial reasoning. Initially at the start i had trouble with the puzzle game but on the last day i managed to do it really quickly",3,4,2,5,3,2,5,2,4,"Mass memorization, cause there's SO MUCH OF IT","Name recognition, as I had prior knowledge to most of the things i saw in it","Yes, i think its repetition which allowed me to get used to it",3,Differences in the games to test the different cognitive skills,THE UI PLS THE MODE AND CHOICES U CAN USE DIFF BUTTONS OR SMT THE CSS STYLING....,"I think you can add more interactivity with the different games, or add more games to test each cognitive skill. ALSO THE UI PLSSSSS",It was fun i hope you do well in ur fyp brother
3/20/2025 22:57,Koh Elin,Mode 1,4,5,4,4,4,Si. I can recognise more of the problems and act quicker than the first time.,5,2,3,4,2,3,4,1,3,Mass Memorization personally for me is the hardest because seeing and remembering all of the information at once can be quite overwhelming.. plus my memory is not the greatest.,Sequence Memorization was the easiest because I find it easier to identify and differentiate the visuals from each other.,"yess! The 3 day consecutive quizzes definitely helped to train my brain to be more active, and learn to problem solve better.",5,"That it is interactive and engaging, honestly very fun!",The puzzle was glitching... all of the pieces didn't come out at once.. I'm not sure if I pressed it correctly.,"Different visuals? Maybe instead of flags or characters, it could be patterns? ",Engaging!! I actually found it fun :)
3/20/2025 22:45,Le Ngoc Mai,Mode 1,4,4,3,3,2,maybe attention span. cuz theres a time limit. i feel like i exercise more brain power trying to memorize stuff too...,4,3,5,2,1,1,4,3,5,the tile puzzle. i never figured out a strat so i just anyhow click,"the name recognition, there was only 6 so thats quite easy. also the flipping,cuz theres only a few pairs",not really. the pokemon was SO MUCH HARDER cuz i dont have pre knowledge. i cruise by MBTI one,5,"the developer. jk, games are pretty fun. needa use brain though",NA,maybe increase level of difficulty by day (for all stages)? so like 5 pairs 1st day then 8 pairs then 10 pairs or sum. ,thank u~ fun~
3/20/2025 11:01,Melody Tham,Mode 1,2,4,4,3,2,"Pattern recognition, based on how I found the cognitive test easier. Also problem solving somewhat, slide puzzle had improvement. ",3,3,2,3,2,1,4,1,4,"Mass Memorization. I was unable to figure out an effective way to memorise multiple objects; felt only able to have like three or four stick in my mind and the rest had to think about it harder. I feel it was due to the many choices overwhelming my memory as unable to concentrate, because I could remember six terms for other stages but only three~four for this.","Name recognition, clear terms and had enough time to remember them.","Somewhat, I feel that certain gamemodes got better eg. slide puzzle/card flipping. Certain gamemodes no change eg. mass memorization.",4,I enjoy such IQ games. Also I appreciate the checkpoint of cognitive tests to see whether there is improvement (regardless whether accurate or not I like the idea of checkpoints).,"I quite enjoyed Memflip, maybe just the aesthetics could be improved to look more developed I guess.","Aesthetics and it would be nice if there was a pull factor? Something to make one continue using the app, currently I would just take it as a one-time test thing out of interest.",VERY NICE
3/20/2025 22:51,Tan Zhi Yi Stefan,Mode 1,2,3,4,3,3,Pattern recognition as i had to ponder a lot of questions for the spanish test and learn the patterns.,2,2,3,4,3,3,5,2,4,Mass Memorization as i cannot remember that well. My short term memory is not very good.,"Name recognition, as we had unlimited time to memorise the names","Not really, amount of time spent on such activities is too little",3,The opportunity to challenge myself,"The last game, as i have not found a reliable way to finish it",Increase the number of game modes,"Interesting, and thought provoking. Gave me an opportunity to better understand my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to cognitive abilities."
3/20/2025 23:11,Teh Xue Yi,Mode 1,3,4,3,4,3,"Yes. I was able to think of more ways to solve the puzzles in the test, and was able to recognise patterns easier",3,4,4,3,3,1,5,2,3,"Mass memorization, memorising so many words within such a short time was challenging, especially with words that I wasn't familiar with",Name recognition. I could always go back to review the names if I forgot one or two,"I found myself being able to match pairs (stage 1) easier, since eventually I started to get a hang of the game. I got better at memorising sequences since day 1 as I tried to notice markers I could use to memorise the pictures more efficiently.",4,The different themes every day,mass memorisation was hard,"maybe less words and slightly shorter times for mass memorisation, i find it hard to focus on so many words for so long","it was very engaging and honestly some of the games were pretty fun to do, i liked the sliding puzzle game "
3/20/2025 10:52,Victoria Wong Xuan Ting,Mode 1,4,3,3,3,2,I didn't feel an improvement but I did improve in the cognitive test so I'm sure memflip had a part to play in that,4,4,2,3,3,2,2,1,3,"Card flipping, I felt that there wasn't even time for me to look at all the cards properly before they turned","Sequence memorization, because the order was easy to remember","I felt a drastic improvement for the sliding tile puzzle from Day 1 to Day 2, because I didnt have to reset multiple times and it felt slightly easier ",4,They were simple tasks yet helped to train me cognitively,"It was very humbling to see the number of moves I had to use in the sliding tile puzzle but thats just a me problem, no hate to memflip i think it's awesome","card matching game in the first stage can have more time before they flip over, because i wasnt able to see everything fully","a well-conducted experiment and very organised, with a briefing for participants that was easy to follow"
3/20/2025 22:58,Gue Tong En Ashley,Mode 2,2,5,4,4,5,"Not sure if I can guarantee that it is an improvement in cognitive abilities, but the tasks in the games became more doable as I got used to it and learnt how to do it most effectively",4,3,4,2,5,1,3,1,2,"The card flipping, there was very little time to memorize the cards, almost couldnt read finish all of them",Name Recognition probably because its unlimited time to memorize,"Yes, i think i got used to the format and tried to do the stages in a way that would be best for me",4,"The last stage hahahah love puzzle fixing so fun, but also because it kinda lets you know about your cognitive skills",The first stage time is a little too short for any proper memory work to be done,None! If its gonna be launched as a public game maybe just the gamification side of it like the interface and points and how you can collect stuff and level up,Fun! Really could tell what im weak or better at ahha
3/20/2025 10:53,Janelle Low Chia Yee,Mode 2,2,5,4,5,4,"I think my pattern recognition was really tested when I had to memorise the sequence of the images appearing, I would look out for the characteristics like colour or male/female character to help me do the exercise.",1,2,5,3,1,2,4,3,4,"Mass memorisation. When the terms used are not familiar eg Pokemon names, country names that are not commonly used, it is hard for me to memorise and reproduce it in written form. Memorising the syllables is hard because I see the word and I don’t say it. It felt like it wasn’t really going through my head.",Card flipping except for the time limit heh. Easiest because there were lesser quantities and there is the chance to continue the game even when you forget where 1 card was placed.,"Sort of. I think i got familiar with how the game works and what I needed to do, so it gave me more clarity.",3,Sliding tile game,Pokemon is so hard,More games! More brain bobbling stuff to train without a time limit,Fun

3/20/2025 10:53,Lee Xiang Lin Darren,Mode 2,2,5,3,3,3,A little bit. The games got easier as the days went by,5,5,1,4,4,2,4,2,5,Sliding tile puzzle. Its confusing haha,Name recognition. Once i associate the names to the picture its easy,Getting used to the brain muscles required for each game maybe? Like for each game i need to maybe quickly remember or i can take my time to remember. And find strategies that work,5,The games in it are quite fun and challenging. Makes me move my brain muscles. Its a good way to wake up haha ,Would like to have more games :) ,"Its pretty fun, hopefully will have more things for us to play haha",Its interesting to see how just a short span of 3 days can train our minds in certain ways. Pretty cool! 
3/21/2025 0:53,Loh Jie Shuen Jeremy,Mode 2,2,4,2,4,3,I think my pattern recognition improved since I was more aware of the questions looming ahead and constantly tried to find ways to better remember the patterns.,1,5,3,2,4,2,3,3,5,"Sliding tile puzzle. Any prior knowledge of the topic will not give you an advantage, and you need to be patient when doing this game but I am quite an impatient person.",Name recognition. There were only a few things to memorise and you could take your time to memorise before proceeding.,"Yes. I started to get familiar with the questions, and my familiarity of the topics also increased as the days went by.",5,The game stages were varied and quite fun.,"Doing day 1 puts me at a huge disadvantage because I did not understand some of the instructions fully and were taken by surprise. Thus, this might affect the results unless it was intentional.",Not sure if prior knowledge of the topics will affect the answers and thus should try to choose topics that sets everyone on an equal foot to ensure the least biased responses.,It was quite fun and engaging. I can see the thought process behind the game stages and I thought it was reasonably balanced. Good job Marvell!!!
3/20/2025 10:59,Nayoyos Kenneth Moli Akiapas,Mode 2,3,4,4,4,4,"I do feel like there was an improvement in how I approach the task, but in terms of my own cognitive abilities, it's hard to say. I definitely found better strategies for the game though",1,4,3,3,4,1,4,3,3,It's a tie between the card flipping and mass memorization for me. The card flip was difficult purely because if the time pressure. The mass memorization was hard because i didn't have a plan on how to quickly memorise the names,"Stage 2, Name recognition because there was no time limit, we could spend all day coming up with ways to memorise each card","Yes, naturally because just like any skill, the more you do something the better you become. In particular to this game, I found better strategies to handle various task like the sliding puzzle for example. At first it was hard but once I focused only on sorting the tiles by numbers instead of the photos, it got a million times easier",4,"I found the sliding tile the most fun for me. I guess because it didn't rely on any inherent cognitive traits like how fast I am at memorising. Also, there are different ways to solve this same puzzle","The mass memorization was pretty hard because the more I tried to recall everything, I just forget. ","For better engagement, you could try adding in sound effects and animations. Also, I feel like the topic of choice should be neutral. For example pokemon, I'm sure a lot of people didn't need to spend any effort memorising because they know those characters by heart so their performance could be a bit biased","Pretty fun overall, I do enjoy playing little puzzle games"
3/20/2025 11:00,Sih Chee Seng,Mode 2,2,5,2,5,5,"Yes but minimal.
1) The games help with cognitive training but 3 days is too short to result in any conclusive improvement.
2) The performance in the subsequent 2 days of MemFlip had some familiarity bias since it contained content from popular culture (ie pokemon, mbti), which might have confounded the performance and results.
3) The attribute tested for the cognitive test pertains more to patterns and reasoning while the MemFlip exercise pertains more to short-term memory and attention span.",2,2,1,3,1,3,5,2,3,"Mass Memorization.
1) Average human brains are only wired to memorize up to 7 objects by default without prior training","Card Flipping
1) There were not many cards and the tasks allowed for repeat tries to get the correct answer.","Yes but minimal.
1) The improvement is based on the anticipation of the tasks and refinement in strategy to tackle the task. The actual cognitive improvement is uncertain.",5,"Fun, challenging and engaging",NA,NA,Very fun and meaningful. Hopefully the results show something correlational and impactful.
